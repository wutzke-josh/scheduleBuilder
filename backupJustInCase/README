# ============================
# Name: Josh Wutzke, Sarah Hildt, and Jordan Rusk
# CMPUT 275, Winter 2020
#
# Final Project
# ============================

Included Files:
	README	
	ourschedule.cpp
	Makefile
	schedule.cpp
	schedule.h
	sectionList.txt
	classList.txt

Running Instructions:
	
	Have all files in the same directory. Type make to make the ourschedule executable. Proceed to type ./ourschedule sectionList.txt to run the code. Enter your user preferences as indicated on the terminal. Be precise, as capitalization, spacing, and punctuation matter. To see the list of valid classes, open classList.txt.

Work Breakdown: 

	COLLABORATED VIA GOOGLE HANGOUTS FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE PROJECT

	Josh: Contributed to design of algorithms for makeSchedule functions, as well as user preferences
	Sarah: Contributed to design of file parser and user interface
	Jordan: Contributed to design of test files and checkConflict function

Notes and Assumptions:

	The program was designed under the assumption that the most classes encountered by a user will be 10 (as most students will not have 11+ classes in a schedule)

	The slow schedule maker runs a greedy algorithm on each permutation of the class vector to determine the optimal schedule. It should generally be used for inputs less than 8, as the difference in time between it and the fast schedule is very small. 

	The fast function does not necessarily produce the best schedule, but it will produce a reasonably good schedule in dramatically less time. Therefore, it should be used for larger inputs.
